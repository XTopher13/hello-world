# Games
**Weeding Game** - A game for removing weeds experimenting with different strategies.

**SolarPunk Stardew** - A stardew valley clone with more paths than farming where players can specialize or branch-out on different jobs
- Researcher
- Artist
- Baker
- Farmer
- Tree Reclamation
- Builder

# Work
**Dependency Task Estimator** - A utilitiy that estimates the time and resources required to fulfill several dependencies that roll up to the overall task.
- Provides stacked bar chart to show where much of the time is spent.

# Agriculture
**Farm Layers** - A utilitiy to view the data at each section of a plot of land.
- Provides a map of the plot using a grid/matrix with several different measurements: 
	- Soil type
	- Moisture content
	- Crop yield
	- Herbicide, pesticide, or fungicide presence
	- Elevation
	- Shade

**Garden Planner** - Focusing on Spacing and simple colors - expand the plants by season for intercropping and continuous harvest. It should model the size and shade cast by plants at various stages.

# Solarpunk and Eco-Friendly
**Library of Things** - Library extensions for tools, equipment, perishables and other items with additional fields for instructions, size, story, etc.

**Communal Extension** 
- An editor of the Library (or other applications) that enables development version control tools that allows users to interface with a service or game to provide research for extensions.
- Version Control, PR, Blockchain? for contributions
Examples:
- An interface with a garden game to add new plants based on research (provided as references) to be reviewed by others and approved. - Would likely need moderators to ensure we don't end up with silly things added.
	- This may start with research and then move to a phase for art or mechanics
	- Perhaps there is a form with variables required and references to those variables?
	- It could allow a user to modify an existing element or add a brand new one.
- An interface with the Library of Things where a person can add a new Item or even Item type to be reviewed by others and approved.
- Extensions to the Solarpunk world (game or imagination) based on research or ideas | collaborative world-building

**Energy Calculator**
- Where can we turn down the lights, return to analog, or stake some energy vampires? Where does it make sense to do so without squashing the value added by energy? Where can we use the law of diminishing returns to our advantage to make large cuts in energy for minimal cuts in experience?

**Carbon Calculator**
- Calculate the carbon (or methane, etc.) used by specific meals, activities, travel, etc. using an external library (API) of data

# Research
## AI
**Minimum Prompt** - Validate that having fewer prompts is actually fewer resources, then learn how to reduce prompts to still get accurate results.

**AI Heuristic** - Based on different factors (quality, energy usage, benefit, ethics), is __this use-case__ a good time to use AI?


# Fun
**Sleeper** - Rank fantasy football teams using the Sleeper API and optimize for silly variables.
- Give me the best team for Best-Ball where all the player's names start with "C"

**Trade-Calculator** - Given a current state and desired future state, provide a flow diagram of "fair" trades to move through the states.
- Ideally we can provide the model with feedback to develop a "personality" for each member that the trades are conducted with to improve the models accuracy.
